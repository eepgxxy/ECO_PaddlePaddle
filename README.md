## Introduction

This repository contains all the required codes and results for the [PaddlePaddle](https://github.com/paddlepaddle) implementation of the paper ECO: Efficient Convolutional Network for Online Video Understanding.

## Environment

Python 3.7.4
PaddlePaddle 1.8.0

## Training on manually splited UCF-101

The UCF-101 dataset is manually splited between training, evaluating and testing with 9090 videos for training, 909 videos for evaluating and 3321 videos for testing. 

The final accuracy result on the testing part is about 94.34%.

The later fine-tuning stage for training and evaluating is shown in the following image.

## Training on trainlist01 of UCF-101

Preliminary training is also done on the trainlist01 of UCF-101 dataset and testing is done on testlist01. 

In order to make the label ID starting from 0, the label IDs in classInd.txt file are each being decreased by 1 during training and testing.

The final accuracy result on the testing part is currently not optimal because of limited hardware capacity available resulting in small batch size. Further training using larger batch size is needed.

## Other experiments

The network architecture for this model is Inception + 3DResNet based on the original paper. Other network architectures are explored, such as ResNet + 3DResNet, and similar results are found.

## TBD

Further experiments will be done and update will be made here.
